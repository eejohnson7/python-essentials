'''
Now you're in control, Space Explorer! Write a program that takes text and an integer as a shift value to encrypt it by 
shifting each letter by the shift value in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters should remain the same.

# TODO: Define a function to encrypt the text using a shift cipher
# The function should take two parameters: the text to encrypt and the shift amount

# TODO: Inside the function, create a loop that goes through each character of the text

    # TODO: Check if the current character is an alphabetic character

        # TODO: Perform the character shift operation and append the result to the encrypted text
        # Hint: Use 'ord', 'chr', and modulo (%) operations to cyclically shift the letter by `shift`

    # TODO: If the character is not alphabetic, add it as is to the encrypted text

# TODO: Outside the function, call your `encrypt_text` function with some sample text and a shift value to test it
